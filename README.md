# Automatated plant watering system

Microprocessors 2021 project

Repo will initially contain rough drafts of my codes, and final ones later on.

### Flowchart

measure water level using soil-moisture sensor  -->  calculate rate of change of moisture (avoid leaching with fast-flowing water)  -->  adjust speed of water pump depending on moisture level *and* speed of pump
